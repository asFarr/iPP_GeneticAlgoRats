# Genetic Algorithm Practice: Breeding Rats v0.2 - by asFarr


Project is based on a chapter from Impractical Python Projects by: Lee Vaughan


It implements a simple genetic algorithm to 'breed rats' as a demonstration of refining labelled 
and weighted data stochastically over successive epochs to fit to parameterized constraints.



...At least that's my high-level takeaway, though I fully admit I might have butchered it in an attempt at brevity. 



I have also departed from the scope of the original book project in order to explore TKinter, TTK, and Matplotlib 
to study applying those modules for UI-driven data visualization. That UI is incomplete but is able to demonstrate proof-of-concept.
